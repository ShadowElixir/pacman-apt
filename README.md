# pacman-apt
Pacman and Apt for Windows.

This replaces [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) with pacman, and [Choco](https://chocolatey.org/) with apt.

Compatible with my [Better Powershell Profile](https://github.com/ShadowElixir/better-powershell-profile).

# Installation
Run this in Powershell:
```
irm cutt.ly/pacman-apt | iex
```
